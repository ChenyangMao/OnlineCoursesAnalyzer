# OnlineCoursesAnalyzer
[CS209A-23Spring] Assignment 1
Online Courses from edX Analysis  
In this assignment, you will design an OnlineCoursesAnalyzer class, which could read an Online Courses dataset from edX and perform various useful analyses. You'll have a chance to use techniques such as Collections, Lambda, and Streams, which we've covered in the lectures.  
The OnlineCoursesAnalyzer class has one constructor that reads a dataset file from a given path. This class also has 6 other methods that perform data analyses. You'll implement these methods in the OnlineCoursesAnalyzer class.
